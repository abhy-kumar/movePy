# movePy
Some random idea which I had in mind since a while.

This is just a tiny script which separates files in my cluttered downloads folder by their extensions.
To use just change the folder in path variable to your own and run it. 
I'll think about adding a more dynamic and user-friendly approach with maybe progress bars or something if needed, but until then, it works fine.
